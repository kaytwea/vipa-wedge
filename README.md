# A model for VIPAs with nonparallel mirrors
These MATLAB scripts encode the model described in ...  

*** Work in progress ***

## Short background
The virtually-imaged phased array (VIPA) is an etalon with a window.  It operates as a spectral disperser, like a diffraction grating.  As a parallel-plate interferometer, its ideal response to monochromatic input is an Airy fringe pattern.  However, when the VIPA mirrors are not perfectly parallel, nonideal instrument behaviour can arise.
