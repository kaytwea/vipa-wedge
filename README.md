# A model for VIPAs with nonparallel mirrors
These MATLAB scripts (v2018a) encode the model described in [an article submitted for publication].  They can compute all fringe pattern data, associated with the computational model, used in the paper.

## Short background
The virtually-imaged phased array (VIPA) is an etalon with a window that operates as a spectral disperser, like a diffraction grating.  It is typically paired with a lens that images the dispersed spectrum onto an image plane.  As a parallel-plate interferometer, its ideal response to monochromatic input is an Airy fringe pattern.  However, when the VIPA mirrors are not perfectly parallel, nonideal instrument behaviour can arise.

This model computes monochromatic fringe patterns generated by air-spaced VIPAs with nonparallel mirrors, and imaged at specifiable distances from the lens.  As fringe patterns characterize instrument performance, model output can resolve nonideal VIPA behaviour along combined dimensions of the dispersion axis and image plane distance.  Although the model was developed for air-spaced VIPAs, results are applicable to solid-body VIPAs, and other etalons.
